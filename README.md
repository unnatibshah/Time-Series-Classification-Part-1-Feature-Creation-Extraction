# Time-Series-Classification-Part-1-Feature-Creation-Extraction
In this problem, we will classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network.

Download the AReM data from: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+system+based+on+Multisensor+data+fusion+\%28AReM\%29. The dataset contains 7 folders that represent seven types of activities. In each folder, there are multiple files each of which represents an instant of a human performing an activity.Each file containis 6 time series collected from activities of the same person, which are called avg_rss12, var_rss12, avg_rss13, var_rss13, vg_rss23, and ar_rss23. There are 88 instances in the dataset, each of which contains 6 time series and each time series has 480 consecutive values.
